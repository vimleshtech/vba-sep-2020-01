	3 - wednesday 
	...
	...
	
	a - add
	s - sub	
	...

	val>80
		..

        result = "insufficiet"

End Select


Loop: is iterator or repeation of statement
====================================================
Example
	1 2 3 4 5 ..... 100  incrementer
	100 99 98 ...... 1   decrementer 
	
	Concepts	
		- init/start from 		1	100
		- condition/limit		100	1	
		- step/increent/decrement	+1	-1

There are following types of loop
	i. do unitl loop 
		syntax
			DO [until condition]		' start from 
				statement
			Loop				' end with 

			or 

			Do			'start from
				statement

			Loop [until condition]	'end with 


	ii.do while loop 
			Do while [condition]
				statement 
			Loop	

			or
			
			Do While
				statement 

			Loop [Condition]
			
	iii. for loop 
			For counter = start To End [Step Value]
				statement 
			Next [counter]			
	iv. foreach
