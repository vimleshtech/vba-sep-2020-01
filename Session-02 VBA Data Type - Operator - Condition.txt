	Correct syntax to declare variable
		Dim ab
		Dim a1

		<=		is less than and equal 
		=		is equal 
		<>		is not equal 
	
	Logical Operator
		AND		a>b AND a>c  if both condition match then result will be true otherwise false
		OR		a>b OR a>c   if both condition not match then resutl will be false otherwise true
